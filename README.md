### How to connect to the data API

Production Endpoint üëâ https://quake-ds-production.herokuapp.com/  
Staging Endpoint üëâ https://quake-ds-staging.herokuapp.com/

#### Overview of Main Routes

| Method | Endpoint                | Access Control | Description                                  |
| ------ | ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/lastQuake/SOURCE/MAGNITUDE` | all users      | Returns the last quake over the given magnitude from the source  |
| GET    | `/last/SOURCE/TIME/MAGNITUDE` | all users      | Gets the quakes over the given timeframe |
| GET    | `/history/SOURCE/LAT,LON,DIST` | all users      | Returns all quakes in a given area |
| GET |`/zip/ZIPCODE/DIST` | all users | Returns last quake in a given area |
| GET, POST | `/comments/SOURCE/QUAKE` | all users |Gets or Posts comments about quakes |
### How to use the routes

1. `/lastQuake/SOURCE/MAGNITUDE` - Returns the last quake over the given magnitude from the source 

`SOURCE`: choice of 'USGS' or 'EMSC' depending on which datasource to pull from 
`MAGNITUDE`: a number 0-11 (accepts floats and ints) defaults to 5.5

2. `/last/SOURCE/TIME/MAGNITUDE` - Gets the quakes over the given timeframe

`SOURCE`: choice of 'USGS' or 'EMSC' depending on which datasource to pull from 
`TIME`: choice of 'hour', 'day', 'week' or 'month', returns quakes over the given time period
`MAGNITUDE`: a number 0-11 (accepts floats and ints) defaults to 5.5

3. `/history/SOURCE/LAT,LON,DIST` - Returns all quakes in a given area

`SOURCE`: choice of 'USGS' or 'EMSC' depending on which datasource to pull from
`LAT` and `LON` are the central latitude and longitude  
`DIST` is the distance in miles from the center to search from

4. `/zip/ZIPCODE/DIST` - reutrns last quake around a given zip code

`ZIPCODE`: a US 5 digit zip code
`DIST`: the distance out to check for the last quake, defaults to 20km

5. `/comments/SOURCE/QUAKE` - gets or posts comments about quakes

`SOURCE`: choice of 'USGS' or 'EMSC' depending on which datasource the quake is in
`QUAKE`: the earthquake's ID number
