## Endpoints

### How to connect to the data API

Production Endpoint ðŸ‘‰ https://quake-ds-production.herokuapp.com/  
Staging Endpoint ðŸ‘‰ https://quake-ds-staging.herokuapp.com/

#### Overview of Main Routes

| Method | Endpoint                | Access Control | Description                                  |
| ------ | ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/lastQuake/SOURCE/MAGNITUDE` | all users      | Returns the last quake over the given magnitude from the source  |
| GET    | `/last/SOURCE/TIME/MAGNITUDE` | all users      | Gets the quakes over the given timeframe |
| GET    | `/history/SOURCE/LAT,LON,DIST` | all users      | Returns all quakes in a given area |
| GET |`/zip/ZIPCODE/DIST` | all users | Returns last quake in a given area |
| GET, POST | `/comments/SOURCE/QUAKE` | all users |Gets or Posts comments about quakes |
### How to use the routes

1. `/lastQuake/SOURCE/MAGNITUDE` - Returns the last quake over the given magnitude from the source 

`SOURCE`: choice of 'USGS' or 'EMSC' depending on which datasource to pull from 
`MAGNITUDE`: a number 0-11 (accepts floats and ints) defaults to 5.5

2. `/last/SOURCE/TIME/MAGNITUDE` - Gets the quakes over the given timeframe

`SOURCE`: choice of 'USGS' or 'EMSC' depending on which datasource to pull from 
`TIME`: choice of 'hour', 'day', 'week' or 'month', returns quakes over the given time period
`MAGNITUDE`: a number 0-11 (accepts floats and ints) defaults to 5.5

3. `/history/SOURCE/LAT,LON,DIST` - Returns all quakes in a given area

`SOURCE`: choice of 'USGS' or 'EMSC' depending on which datasource to pull from
`LAT` and `LON` are the central latitude and longitude  
`DIST` is the distance in miles from the center to search from

4. `/zip/ZIPCODE/DIST` - reutrns last quake around a given zip code

`ZIPCODE`: a US 5 digit zip code
`DIST`: the distance out to check for the last quake, defaults to 20km

5. `/comments/SOURCE/QUAKE` - gets or posts comments about quakes

`SOURCE`: choice of 'USGS' or 'EMSC' depending on which datasource the quake is in
`QUAKE`: the earthquake's ID number

### Response Format
The history routes will return data in the following format:
```
 "message": Contains the quakes returned in format:
         "Oceanic": a boolean value for if the quake was in the ocean (only for USGS quakes, not reliable),
         "id": A numerical id of the quake in our database (unique per quake),
         "lat": lattitude in degrees
         "lon": longitude in degrees
         "mag": Magnitude of the earthquake
         "place": a Human readable representation of approximatly where the quake is
         "time": the time that the quake occured in UTC in ms since Epoch}
 "num_quakes": the number of quakes returned
 "status_code": standard web status codes
 "boundingA": Only returned on history route, Northwest corner of the bounding box
 "boundingB": Only returned on history route, Southeast corner of the bounding box
 ```
 The comments route will return data in the following format:
 ```
 "message": contains a list of comments in the format:
        "name": the display name of the User
        "comment": the comment
"num_comments": the number of comments returned
"status_code": web status codes
```

### Architecture

![architecture](assets/quake-labs-architect-diagram.png)

## Data Sources

    Our primary data source is the USGS geojson feed. [View the documentation](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php), or [search their data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/).
    For a further history of earthquakes we also collected the data available on [EMSC](https://www.emsc-csem.org/Earthquake/)
