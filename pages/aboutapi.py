        The Quake Labs API is powered by two AWS Lambda functions which collect data from USGS and EMSC's publicly
        available earthquake data and stores it in an AWS RDS instance. The fucntion of this app is to provide easy access
        to earthquake information and provide alerts to affected individuals who sign up for text alerts.

            1. `/lastQuake/SOURCE/MAGNITUDE` - Returns the last quake over the given magnitude from the source

            `SOURCE`: choice of 'USGS' or 'EMSC' depending on which datasource to pull from

            `MAGNITUDE`: a number 0-11 (accepts floats and ints) defaults to 5.5

            2. `/last/SOURCE/TIME/MAGNITUDE` - Gets the quakes over the given timeframe

            `SOURCE`: choice of 'USGS' or 'EMSC' depending on which datasource to pull from

            `TIME`: choice of 'hour', 'day', 'week' or 'month', returns quakes over the given time period

            `MAGNITUDE`: a number 0-11 (accepts floats and ints) defaults to 5.5

            3. `/history/SOURCE/LAT,LON,DIST` - Returns all quakes in a given area

            `SOURCE`: choice of 'USGS' or 'EMSC' depending on which datasource to pull from

            `LAT` and `LON` are the central latitude and longitude

            `DIST` is the distance in miles from the center to search from

            4. `/zip/ZIPCODE/DIST` - reutrns last quake around a given zip code

            `ZIPCODE`: a US 5 digit zip code

            `DIST`: the distance out to check for the last quake, defaults to 20km

            5. `/comments/SOURCE/QUAKE` - gets or posts comments about quakes

            `SOURCE`: choice of 'USGS' or 'EMSC' depending on which datasource the quake is in

            `QUAKE`: the earthquake's ID number''')
